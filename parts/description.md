# Develop Android apps using Python and PyQt5
Are you going to build a mobile app for **Android** using **Python** or are you just curious what's possible in your programming language of choice then this book is for you. 
This book covers the full process from installing over coding to deploying an app for Android using Python, Qt5, PyQt5 and Visual Studio Code.
This book covers both the imperative approach using QtWigets and the declarative approach using QtQuick and QML.
We are also creating a possibility to **hot reload** your apps so that you are able to test them on your device without the need of recompiling. This speeds up the development circle so that you are able to develop your apps faster than using legacy tools like android studio.
All methods used in this book also enables you to develop app for **iOS** even if it's not stated elsewhere.
