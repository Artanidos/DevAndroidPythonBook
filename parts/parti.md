# Part I - Prolog  

## 1. Installation  
Here we are going to install all necessary software to be able to write code and test it at least on the desktop. 
To be able to also deploy the app to an Android device we will install additional software in the deployment chapter later in this book. 

I assume that you already have installed Python3 and Pip. If not you should find all necessary information on the [Python](https://python.org) website. 
I also assume that you able to install software using pip. 

First we will install [PyQt5] (https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) which comes together with Qt5 to be able to code applications for the desktop. 
```
pip install PyQt5
```

Then we will install [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is free and open source and has many good extensions to develop Python code. 
You can download VSCode [here] (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). I assume that you are able to install VSCode on your own. Otherwise you will find installation instructions on this website. 
You can also use apt if you are on a Linux system. 
Use google search if there are some prerequisits missing. 
```
sudo apt install code
```
In the next chapter we will setup the environment to be able to write our first app.
